# Mathematics for AI Engineer

> Context map for mathematical knowledge required by an **AI Engineer**.  
> This note does **not create new atomic math concepts**.  
> It **routes to AI-relevant lenses** over shared mathematics.

AI engineering needs mathematics to:
- reason about uncertainty and data behavior
- understand model behavior and failure modes
- debug numerical and optimization issues
- reason about scale, approximation, and constraints in systems
