# Linear Algebra for AI

> Context map for **linear algebra concepts used in AI systems**.  

Linear algebra in AI is used to:
- represent data, parameters, and embeddings
- transform representations through models
- reason about similarity and structure
- understand capacity, degeneracy, and stability
- reason about behavior in high-dimensional spaces

---

## 1. Vectors for AI
> Linear algebra objects representing data and features.

- data points as vectors
- feature vectors
- embedding vectors
- norms, dot products, similarity

→ [[Vectors for AI]]

## 2. Matrices for AI
> Linear algebra objects representing parameters and structured data.

- data matrices
- weight matrices
- embedding matrices
- matrix operations used in models
- invertibility, rank, conditioning
- spectral intuition (AI level)

→ [[Matrices for AI]]

---

## 3. Linear Transformations for AI
> How matrices **act** on vectors and representations.

- matrices as operators
- composition of transformations
- projections and information loss
- rank as capacity
- transformation intuition in models

→ [[Linear Transformations for AI]]

---

## 4. High-Dimensional Linear Algebra
> Same linear algebra, **different dominant behavior**.

- curse of dimensionality
- distance concentration
- orthogonality effects
- embedding geometry intuition

→ [[High-Dimensional Linear Algebra]]

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- proof-heavy linear algebra
- abstract vector space theory
- canonical matrix forms
- advanced decompositions (unless added later intentionally)
