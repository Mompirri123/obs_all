# Vectors for AI

> Context map for **vectors as used in AI systems**.  
> This note groups all AI-related vector concepts into clear sub-blocks.

Vectors in AI are used to:
- represent data points and features
- encode similarity and meaning
- act as inputs and outputs of models
- form embeddings and latent representations
- operate in high-dimensional spaces

---

## 1. Vector Basics for AI
> What a vector means in AI practice.

- vectors as ordered numerical representations
- dimensionality
- feature vectors vs parameter vectors
- single vector vs batch of vectors

→ [[Vector Basics for AI]]

## 2. Vector Geometry & Similarity
> How vectors relate to each other.

- vector magnitude (norm intuition)
- dot product (alignment)
- cosine similarity
- distance vs similarity
- angle-based reasoning

→ [[Vector Geometry & Similarity]]

---

## 3. Vector Representations in AI
> Vectors as learned representations.

- embeddings as vectors
- semantic meaning in vector space
- feature representations
- learned vs hand-crafted vectors
- vectors across model layers

→ [[Vector Representations in AI]]

---

## 4. High-Dimensional Vector Behavior
> When intuition breaks.

- near-orthogonality of random vectors
- distance concentration
- similarity degradation
- implications for nearest-neighbor search

→ [[High-Dimensional Vector Behavior]]

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- abstract vector space axioms
- proof-heavy vector theory
- coordinate-free formulations
- non-Euclidean spaces (unless added later)
