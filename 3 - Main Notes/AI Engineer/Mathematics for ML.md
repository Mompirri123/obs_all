# Mathematics for ML

> Context map for mathematical concepts used to **build, train, and evaluate machine learning models**.  
> This note **reuses atomic mathematics notes** and organises them from an ML perspective.

Machine learning uses mathematics to:
- model relationships between data and targets
- quantify uncertainty and generalisation
- optimise parameters via loss minimization
- reason about trade-offs in model complexity
