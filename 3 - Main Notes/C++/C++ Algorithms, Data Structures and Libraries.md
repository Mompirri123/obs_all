# C++ Algorithms and Libraries

> Library facilities and algorithmic abstractions provided by C++.

This note groups all **non-core facilities** in C++ that are used to
**store data**, **organize data**, and **operate on data**, but are not part of
the language syntax, semantics, or memory and lifetime rules.

At this level, this space is divided into two **maximal conceptual groupings**.

---

## Conceptual Components

- **[[C++ Libraries]]**  
	- Covers all library facilities in C++, including:
		- the C++ Standard Library
		- STL (as a subset)
		- IO, concurrency, filesystem, numerics, utilities
		- third-party libraries
	  
- **[[C++ Data Structures and Algorithms]]** 
	- Groups data structures and algorithms
	- Includes problem-solving–oriented domain (DSA):
		- STL containers
		- algorithmic techniques
		- complexity considerations.
