# C++ Data Structures

> Data organization techniques and structures used in C++.

- Data structures describe 
	- **how data is laid out in memory** 
	- **how it can be accessed and modified efficiently**
	
- In C++, data structures are closely tied to:
	- the language’s type system
	- memory layout and cache behavior
	- performance trade-offs between different representations
	  
- Both **standard containers** and **custom-built structures** come under this

## Language-level building blocks

C++ data structures are constructed using the language’s abstraction
mechanisms:

- [[structs in C++|C++ Structs]]
- [[Classes in C++]]

These define **layout**, **ownership**, and **behavior** of custom data
structures.
