# Const in C++

> hub for all `const`-related concepts.

- `const` expresses **immutability guarantees** in C++
- what `const` means depends entirely on **where it is placed**

---

## Core const concepts

- [[Const Keyword in C++]]  
    basic meaning and intent of `const`
    
- [[Const Placement Rules in C++]]  
    how placement changes meaning (`const T`, `T const`, `T* const`, `f() const`, etc.).

---

## Const applied to class design

- [[Const Data Members in C++]] 
	  data members that cannot change after construction.
    
- [[Const Member Functions in C++]]  
	  member functions that promise not to modify object state.
    
- [[Const-Correct Getters in C++]] 
	  read-only access patterns
    
- [[Const Objects in C++]]  
	  objects whose state cannot be modified.

---

## Const and object semantics

- [[Const and Copy / Assignment Semantics in C++]]  
	  how const interacts with copying, assignment, and canonical forms.
