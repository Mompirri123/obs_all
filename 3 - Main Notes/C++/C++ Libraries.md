# C++ Libraries

> All library facilities used in C++ programs.

- This note groups **everything that is considered a library in C++**.
- It includes both:
	- **standardized libraries** provided by the language
	- **external libraries** used in real-world C++ development.

---

## Conceptual Components

- **[[C++ Standard Library]]**  
	- All libraries specified by the C++ standard
	- This includes:
		- STL (containers, iterators, algorithms)
		- IO
		- concurrency
		- filesystem
		- numerics
		- utilities
		- other standardized facilities

- **[[Third-party Libraries in C++]]**  
	- Libraries not part of the C++ standard, such as:
		- Boost
		- fmt
		- Eigen
		- ecosystem tooling
		- other third-party libraries
