# C++ Language and Semantics

> Map of Content for the C++ language core

C++ language semantics describe how valid C++ programs are formed and how
meaning is assigned to source code, independent of libraries, tooling, or
resource ownership concerns.

---

## Language core

The language core defines the fundamental rules that govern:

- program structure and syntax
- expression formation and evaluation
- function definition and invocation
- control-flow constructs
- generic abstraction mechanisms
- the compilation model and translation units

## Conceptual Components

- At this level
	- C++ can be understood by separating the language into a small set of fundamental conceptual areas
	- that together define how programs are
		- written
		- evaluated
		- translated.
	
- Language consists of the following conceptual components:
	- ### Surface language structure
		- [[C++ Syntax and Structure]]
		- [[Expressions and Operators in C++]]
		- [[Functions and Callables in C++]]
		- [[Control Flow in C++]]
		- [[Compilation Model and Translation Units]]
	- ### Abstraction mechanisms
		- [[Generic Programming in C++]]
	- ### Semantic foundations
		- [[C++ Type System]]
