# Memory management in C++

> Memory and lifetime rules as defined by the C++ language.

C++ memory management describes how the language specifies:

- where data is stored
- how long it exists
- how it is acquired
- how and when it is released

All concepts related to object lifetime, allocation, ownership, and cleanup
fall under this note.
