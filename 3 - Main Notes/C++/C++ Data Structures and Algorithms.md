# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms

> Data structures and algorithms as used and implemented in C++.

Data structures and algorithms together describe **how data is represented**
and **how computation is performed on that data**.

In C++, this includes:
- choosing appropriate data representations
- understanding the trade-offs between different structures
- applying algorithms that operate efficiently on those structures
- reasoning about time and space complexity in the context of C++ programs

The interaction between data structures and algorithms is central to writing
efficient, scalable, and correct C++ code.
