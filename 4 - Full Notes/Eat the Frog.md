# Eat the Frog

- **Eat the Frog – short explanation**

Eat the Frog means:  
**do the hardest and most important task first.**

That task is the one you keep avoiding.  
If you finish it early, the rest of the day feels easier.

**Why it works**

- Your focus is highest early.
    
- Big tasks cause stress when delayed.
    
- Finishing it gives momentum.

**How to use it**

1. List your tasks.
    
2. Pick the one that matters most and feels hardest.
    
3. Do it first. No distractions.
    
4. Then do the rest.

**If there are two frogs**

- Pick the one with permanent loss if skipped.
- If both are equal, pick the one where effort today gives more marks or results.

**One line to remember**

> Do the most important hard thing first, before anything else.
