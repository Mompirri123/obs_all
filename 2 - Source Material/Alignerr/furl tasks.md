|             | Path immutability + absolute-path preservation in `Path.load()`/`Path.add()`                   | `furl/furl.py`        |            70–120 | Reused path objects/lists get mutated, causing later URLs to be wrong.                              |
| [[task 16]] | IPv6-safe `origin` setter parsing (`http://[::1]:8080`)                                        | `furl/furl.py`        |            50–100 | Users cannot set IPv6 origins reliably; local/dev/internal URLs fail.                               |
| [[task 19]] | Refactor netloc parsing into a single helper used by `netloc` + `origin` setters               | `furl/furl.py`        |            90–160 | Inconsistent parsing paths create surprising differences between `origin` and `netloc` assignments. |
|             | Per-label IDNA decode/encode support (e.g. `www.xn--...`)                                      | `furl/furl.py`        |            60–130 | Internationalized domains appear inconsistently (encoded in some flows, decoded in others).         |
| [[task 18]] | Strict-mode warning consistency pass (path/query/fragment)                                     | `furl/furl.py`        |           100–180 | Malformed encoded URLs can slip through silently in one component but warn in another.              |
|             | Query parsing strategy cleanup with explicit delimiter handling policy                         | `furl/furl.py`        |            80–150 | Users paste query strings using `;`/mixed delimiters and get unexpected params.                     |
| [[task 17]] | Improve `furl.remove()` overlap handling with warnings for `args/query/query_params` conflicts | `furl/furl.py`        |             40–90 | Removing params in one call can delete more than users intended.                                    |
|             | Canonicalization helper for scheme/netloc edge cases (`''`, `None`, empty host)                | `furl/furl.py`        |            70–140 | Users see odd URL outputs (`://`, `//`) in edge states and can’t predict serialization.             |
|             | `urlsplit`/`urljoin` scheme normalization refactor for uncommon schemes                        | `furl/furl.py`        |           120–200 | Relative joins behave differently across schemes, breaking redirects/builders.                      |
|             | Packaging/test runner alignment (`tox` vs `setup.py test`)                                     | `setup.py`, `tox.ini` |             30–80 | Contributors run different commands and get different outcomes, causing CI confusion.               |
