## Turn 1

### Turn 1 Prompt:
Add an optional timing mode to `ic` so users can see how long expressions take to run. The API should be a context manager used like `with ic.timing(): ic(foo())`. While this context is active, each `ic()` call should add a clear, human-readable elapsed time, for example `33.5ms`, `1.02s`, or `2m13s`. Elapsed time is measured from when the timing block started. When the timing context is not used, `ic()` must behave exactly as it does now. Return values must stay the same, and the implementation should reuse the existing debugger and formatting logic instead
