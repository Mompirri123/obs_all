## Turn 1

### Turn 1 Prompt:
Add an option to `furl`. The option should give the asked parameters in an order when building URLs. which means that same inputs would always give out the same URL string i.e, cases where same URLs / inputs when converted end up with the same string. Current default behavior should be unchanged. Add tests to confirm proper working of both the new and default behaviors and add tests for any edgecases that need to be tested
