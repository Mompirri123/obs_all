### Pros and cons

#### Model A:
- Pros:
	- Check if ] is present (indicating an IPv6 literal)
	- Find the positions of the last : and last ]
	- Only split on the colon if it appears immediately after the closing bracket (i.e., colonpos == bracketpos + 1 )
	- Use rsplit(':', 1) instead of split(':', 1) for correct port extraction
	
- Cons:

#### Model B:
- Pros:
	
- Cons:

#### Justification for best overall
