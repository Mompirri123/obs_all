# Saves and Logs - task 13

## Turn 1
When names of files are same the way they are handled now is by adding an index at the end which is changing in every run. Instead add a method that uses a proper mechanism to name them
### Turn 1 Prompt:

~~Make duplicate filename handling follow a determined path. Right now it appends an index, which changes across runs. Use a stable hash so the same inputs always produce the same output names, and update the manifest/tests accordingly~~

 Fix the duplicate filename handling issue, where it adds index so names. These names are changing every turn. same input should always gives same output name. Update tests etc.; if needed
