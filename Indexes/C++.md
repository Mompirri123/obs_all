# C++

> Main hub for all C++ notes  
> Links to second-level maps covering language semantics, object-oriented
> programming, memory, libraries, tooling, and historical context.

- C++ is a general-purpose programming language
- C++ is a statically typed language  
	- the type of a variable is determined during compilation
- C++ builds upon the features of C  
	- it originated as an extension of the C programming language  
	- historically described as “C with classes and inheritance”  
	- most C programs can be compiled and run with a C++ compiler
- C++ supports multiple programming paradigms  
	- procedural programming  
	- object-oriented programming  
	- generic programming  
	- low-level and systems programming
- C++ emphasises performance, deterministic behavior, and explicit control
  over resources and object lifetimes

C++ can be understood by dividing the language and its ecosystem into the
following major conceptual areas:

- [[C++ Language and Semantics|Language core and Semantics]]
- [[OOPS in C++|Object-oriented programming]]
- [[Memory management in C++|Memory and lifetime]]
- [[C++ Algorithms, Data Structures and Libraries|Algorithms and libraries]]
- [[C++ Tooling and Project Structure|Tooling and project structure]]
- [[Background and History of C++|Background and evolution]]
