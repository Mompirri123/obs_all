# OOPS in C++

> Object-oriented programming concepts as implemented in C++.

- Object-oriented programming in C++ provides language-level mechanisms to
	- model data and behavior together
	- define interfaces
	- enable reuse
	- substitution through type relationships.
	
- In C++, object-oriented programming coexists with procedural and generic programming
- Integrated with the language’s type system

---

## Object-oriented core

The object-oriented model in C++ is defined by the following fundamental ideas:
- grouping state and behavior into types
- controlling visibility and invariants
- extending and specializing behavior
- enabling substitution via polymorphism

## Conceptual Components

- [[Classes and Objects in C++]]
- [[Encapsulation in C++]]
- [[Inheritance in C++]]
- [[Polymorphism in C++]]
