# C++ Language Features

> Everything about **how the C++ language is written, structured, and reasoned about**  
> independent of _what data types exist_ or _how memory is managed_.

- Language features describe:
	- syntax rules
	- expressions and evaluation
	- how functions are defined and called
	- how control flows
	- how code is compiled and composed
	  
- answers **“how do I write this in C++?”**
---

## 1. Syntax and Structure

> How C++ code is written and organised at the surface level

- It answers what does valid C++ code look like?
	
- This Covers:
	- declarations vs definitions
	- scopes and namespaces
	- statements vs expressions
	- headers vs source files
	- basic grammar of C++
	
-  **Surface layer** of the language - before behaviour or meaning
	
- ***For more details:*** → [[C++ Syntax and Structure]]

## 2. Expressions and Operators

> How C++ computes valuables and combines operations

- This covers:
	- operator categories (`+`, `*`, `==`, `->`, etc.)    
	- operator precedence and associativity
	- expression evaluation rules
	- built-in operator behavior
	  
- ***For more details:*** → [[Expressions and Operators in C++]]

---

## 3. Functions and Callables

> How do we package and call logic?

- This Covers:
	- function declarations and definitions
	- parameters and return values
	- overloading
	- lambdas
	- callable objects (function objects)
	
- ***For more details:*** → [[Functions and Callables in C++]]

---

## 4. Control Flow

> How Execution moves through a program

- This Covers:
	- `if`, `switch`
	- loops (`for`, `while`, range-based for)
	- `break`, `continue`, `return`
	- structured flow of execution
	
- ***For more details:*** → [[Control Flow in C++]]

This is about **how execution moves**, not data or memory.

---

## 5. Generic Programming

→ [[Generic Programming in C++]]

Covers:
- templates as a language mechanism
- template parameters
- specialization
- constraints / concepts (later C++)


This is **how code is abstracted**, not specific data types.

---

## 6. Compilation Model and Translation Units

→ [[Compilation Model and Translation Units]]

Covers:
- preprocessing
- translation units
- linkage
- ODR (One Definition Rule)
- headers vs implementation

This explains **how written code becomes a program**.
